PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A grocery store is facing challenges in managing their inventory, 
purchase orders, and sales due to the inefficiencies and errors 
associated with manual systems. Therefore, there is a need for a 
Grocery Stock Management System using DBMS that can automate 
the process of managing inventory, purchasing, and sales. The system 
stores the details of Product which can be characterised by Product 
ID, name, category, price per unit etc. The Product is supplied by a 
Supplier (Supplier ID, name, phone number, email ID ) who receives 
an Order identified by Order ID,Order date, expected delivery date, 
total order cost.The other entities include customer(customer ID, 
name, phone number, email) , sales order(order ID, order date, total 
cost) and staff(staff ID, name, phone number, email ID).
